# :information_source: Already implemented via itertools.zip_longest()

# Creates a list of elements, grouped based on the position in the original lists.

# Use max combined with list comprehension to get the length of the longest list in 
# the arguments. Loops for max_length times grouping elements. If lengths of lists vary 
# fill_value is used. By default fill_value is None.
